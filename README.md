Diffuse reflectance near infrared spectroscopy and Soil engineering properties data.

This study aimed to assess performance of NIR-PLS for rapid estimation of several soil properties that are 
commonly used in materials indices for civil engineering applications using an independent validation data 
set drawn from the same geographical area. (2014-12-08)
